# Hack The North 2021

## Inspiration ü™Ñ
COVID-19 has impacted us physically and mentally, leaving us to gain a few pounds or even lead to depression. Many individuals are even scared to enter gym facilities again as it contains a greater risk of getting infected. Even after the lockdown, a survey finds Two-thirds of gym members have paused or canceled their fitness contracts (Pat Foran, 2021). We wanted to create an app that eliminates this problem and helps individuals stay fit and healthy from practically anywhere.

## What It Does ‚öôÔ∏è
Fitness Freak allows users to create an account on our platform and customize their daily workout routines based on their preferences. Just like that the user will be welcomed to our home page where the app will track the user's steps, calories and distance traveled regularly. Also provides a tutorial on a few ways to stay fit and healthy. To allow for more fun and engaging platform, Fitness Freak allows you to challenge your friends with great exercises including push-ups, sit-ups, and many more.

## How we Built It üõ†
We built Fitness Freak with React Native, Django Rest Framework (Python), and PostgreSQL. We first designed an overview of how our app would look like on Figma and from there carried out the plan into code.

## Challenges we Ran Into üöß
We wanted to create the best fitness application out there, which meant it will take a lot of time. Unfortunately, given the time limit of 36 hours, we could not implement a few pages into real code. For the pages we were unfortunate enough to implement, we used Figma to help design the prototype version. One of our team members was in the GMT time zone which meant we would all have odd timing to work and get certain tasks completed. But we did not let this bother us as we stayed up a few nights to make sure the goals given that day were completed.

## Accomplishments That we're Proud Of ‚úÖ
This was our team's very first Hackathon which meant we were new to everything here and wanted to make sure we do everything perfectly and correctly. We are proud of getting everything organized and completed right before the deadline.

## What we Learned üìö
We all wanted to create something that wasn't simple which meant doing something unique helpful. Our main app was built with React Native and our team was not too familiar with the language so while creating the project we were learning React Native on the side and are proud of what we got out of it.

## What's Next for Fitness Freak ‚ÄºÔ∏è
This is just the beginning, soon Fitness Freak will create a platform where users are also allowed to video chat and message friends regarding their health goals and challenges to play. As for video chat, it will be a platform allowing users to challenge their friends to a friendly battle where the AI will scan for users' bodies during each push-up and give points when each posture is done correctly.
